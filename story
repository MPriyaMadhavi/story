Once upon a time, there lived a monkey in a berry tree
 beside the river. One day a crocodile came across the river. 
 It saw the monkey on the tree and asked for some juicy berries. 
 
From that day onwards, they both became close friends. The Crocodile would daily come back to the monkey for berries. 
They both would use to have lots of fun together. 
Sometimes the monkey would sit on the crocodile back and 
go around the river. 

Once the crocodile asked the monkey to get him some berries for his wife. 
The monkey plucked some berries and gave them to the crocodile. 

When his wife tasted the berries, 
she grew curious to taste the monkey’s heart. She asked the crocodile to invite the monkey for lunch at their place so that she can eat the monkey's heart.
  The crocodile became very sad
The next day the crocodile asked the monkey to sit on his back and started to his house. As they reached the middle of the river,
 the crocodile told the monkey about his wife’s plan.
